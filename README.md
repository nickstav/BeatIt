TODO...
- Save/load tracks

- Mute/Solo - I would like to be able to mute and solo individual tracks. Muting a track should prevent its enabled steps from playing. Soloing a track should internally mute all other tracks.

- Nudge - I would like to be able to nudge any steps in a particular track one step to the left or right.

- Clear - I would like to be able to completely clear the enabled steps on a particular track.

- Velocity - I would like to be able to toggle each step between high and normal volume.
